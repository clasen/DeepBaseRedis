## üì¶ Installation
```shell
npm install deepbase
```

## üîß Usage
```js
import DeepBase from "deepbase-redis"
const mem = new DeepBase({ name: "db" }); // "db" redis prefix
await mem.connect();
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è Setting Values
```js
await mem.set("config", "lang", "en");

const configLang = await mem.get("config", "lang");
console.log(configLang); // "en"
```

### ‚úÖ Adding Rows
```js
const path = await mem.add("user", { name: "martin" });

// add() will create a secure key (ie. "iKid4OCK")
console.log(path) // [ 'user', 'iKid4OCK' ]

const userName = await mem.get(...path, "name");
console.log(userName); // "martin"
```

### üî¢ Increment fields
```js
await mem.inc(...path, "balance", 160);
await mem.inc(...path, "balance", 420);

const userBalance = await mem.get(...path, "balance");
console.log(userBalance); // 580
```

### ‚öóÔ∏è Update
```js
await mem.upd("config", "lang", v => v.toUpperCase());
const lang = await mem.get("config", "lang"); // EN
```

### üî• Finally
```js
await mem.add("user", { name: "anya" });

const userIds = await mem.keys("user")
console.log(userIds) // [ 'iKid4OCKds', 'F3wORv_Jsd' ]

console.log(await mem.get())
// {
//     config: { lang: 'EN' },
//     user: {
//         iKid4OCKds: { name: 'martin', balance: 580 },
//         F3wORv_Jsd: { name: 'anya' }
//     }
// }
```
